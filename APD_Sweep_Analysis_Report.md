## üîç Sweep-Only Analysis

**Isolated Sweep Trades:**
- **Volume:** -1,017 contracts (net bearish)
- **Dollar Flow:** -$776,529 (bearish flow)
- **Sentiment:** üî¥ **Bearish**

### What This Means:
The detected sweep trades were primarily **institutional hedging or arbitrage** activities that created bearish noise in the data. By removing them, we reveal the true **retail and directional sentiment**, which is significantly more bullish.

---

## üí° Key Takeaways

### üéØ **Why Sweep Detection Matters**
1. **Cleaner Sentiment**: Removing institutional noise reveals true directional bias
2. **Better Signal**: $776k more bullish flow when sweeps are excluded
3. **Institutional vs Retail**: Sweeps were bearish hedging, retail flow is bullish

### üìà **Trading Implications**
- **True Sentiment:** Bullish (retail/smaller players are buying calls)
- **Institutional Activity:** Bearish hedging/arbitrage (not predictive)
- **Key Levels:** Strong call activity at $300, $310, $340, $350, $390
- **Support Levels:** Put protection around $210-$230

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk Considerations**
- Max pain at $330 suggests potential magnet effect
- Heavy institutional positioning may create volatility
- Monitor sweep activity for changes in institutional sentiment
